We picked the first use case. We want to predict the stock market price for Norwegian airlines.

Regression is the best algorithm for this use case beacause we want to predict a continous quantity.
We want the algorithm to return a stock price based on a historic price data model.
Classification could also work if we wanted to predict whether the price would go up or down, but for this scenario
regression is the best option.
